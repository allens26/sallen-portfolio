# sallen-portfolio

For my final project, I've created a professional portfolio covering some of the work I've done while in the iSchool. As this assignment is the very last assignment I'll ever turn in while in the program, this website is itself intended to be an artifact, displaying the skills I've learned in this class. I used Bootstrap as a starting point for my CSS, but also did custom CSS in order to customize things such as headings and backgrounds to my liking.

Thank you both for a great quarter!
